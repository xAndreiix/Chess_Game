# Python Chess GUI ðŸŽ¯

A complete GUI-based chess game implemented in Python using `tkinter` and the powerful `python-chess` engine for move validation and game state management.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

- â”œâ”€â”€ chess_game.py # Main GUI chess game using tkinter
- â”œâ”€â”€ test_chess_game.py # Full test coverage using unittest
- â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore # Git configuration to ignore unnecessary files
- â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file

## ðŸ•¹ Features

- Fully functional 8x8 chess board rendered with Unicode pieces â™”â™•â™–.
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys + `Enter` for move selection.
- Mouse-click interaction for intuitive gameplay.
- Automatic validation of legal moves.
- Detects game over (checkmate, stalemate) and displays the result via popup.
- Clean and modern interface using tkinter.
- Built-in test suite to verify game functionality and rules.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Testing is implemented using the `unittest` module. To run tests:

```bash```
python test_chess_game.py

Test coverage includes:
- Initial board state validation
- Valid and invalid move execution
- Checkmate detection (e.g., Fool's Mate)
- GUI method robustness (update_board)
- Full setup and teardown of the GUI environment

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- python-chess
- tkinter (standard with Python on most systems)
- Install python-chess via pip if not already:
- pip install python-chess

## ðŸš€ Running the Application
python chess_game.py

## ðŸ›¡ Git Integration
This project includes a full .gitignore to avoid cluttering the repository with unnecessary files like __pycache__, .venv/, editor configs, OS metadata, and test caches.

Enjoy playing chess in Python with a beautiful minimal GUI. â™Ÿ
